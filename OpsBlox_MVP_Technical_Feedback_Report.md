## 2. Web Framework Recommendation

### **Current Stack Analysis: Excellent Foundation** âœ…

The current **React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite** setup is well-chosen for this project:

**Why React Works Well Here:**
- Mature e-commerce ecosystem with extensive libraries
- Excellent TypeScript integration (already well-implemented)
- Large talent pool for team scaling
- Rich component ecosystem (current shadcn/ui is excellent choice)

### **Recommended Evolution Path**

For scaling beyond MVP, I recommend a strategic migration to:

```typescript
// Recommended Production Stack
{
  frontend: "Next.js 14 with App Router",
  reasoning: "SSR/SSG for SEO, enhanced performance, built-in optimizations",
  
  backend: "Node.js/Express + tRPC",
  reasoning: "Type-safe APIs, maintain JavaScript ecosystem consistency",
  
  database: "PostgreSQL + Prisma",
  reasoning: "Scalable relational data, excellent TypeScript integration",
  
  ai_integration: "OpenAI API + LangChain",
  reasoning: "Enhanced NLP capabilities for chatbot evolution",
  
  deployment: "Vercel + Railway",
  reasoning: "Optimized for Next.js, seamless CI/CD"
}
```

**Migration Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1:** Maintain current React+Vite for immediate features
2. **Phase 2:** Gradual Next.js migration for SEO-critical pages
3. **Phase 3:** Full migration with enhanced performance optimizations
